This is a portfilio template made using Lume, as static site generator running in Deno. 

## Installation 
to start editing the template, you first need to install Deno for the official [Deno website](https://deno.land/).
After you install Deno, you need to install Lume using the following command: 

---
```
deno run -A https://deno.land/x/lume/install.ts
```

Once you install Lume, you only need to run the following Lume --serve to to start your instance. 

    Lume --serve
