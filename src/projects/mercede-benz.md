# About the project

Mercedes-Benz website redesign and developed using NextJS framework and GaphCMS as a back-end.

This is only for learning purposes, and I am not paid to make this.

See the final website [here](https://mercedes-website-demo.vercel.app/).

Get the code on Github [here](https://github.com/AchrafGarai/mercedes-website-demo).

Thanks for Watching.
